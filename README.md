# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments

In Fade Led I made an LED blink and fade in and out using the metro board

IN the LCD assignment I used an LCD to count how many times I had presssed a button. I got it to say "Button Presses: __" This number went up by one every time I pressed the button

In the Servo assignment I made a servo spin a certain direction by pushing on wires. If i presssed one wired it went clockwise, and if I pressed the other wire it went counter clockwise. Each wire when touched made the servo spin 180% in a different direction

I the Photo Interrupter assignment I printed how many times my photo interrupter had been interrupted. I also made it so it counted every four second and restarted after 4 seconds. It printed the interrupts per 4 seconds into the serial monitor
