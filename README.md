In Fade Led I made an LED blink and fade in and out using the metro board

IN the LCD assignment I used an LCD to count how many times I had presssed a button. I got it to say "Button Presses: __" This number went up by one every time I pressed the button

In the Servo assignment I made a servo spin a certain direction by pushing on wires. If i presssed one wired it went clockwise, and if I pressed the other wire it went counter clockwise. Each wire when touched made the servo spin 180% in a different direction

I the Photo Interrupter assignment I printed how many times my photo interrupter had been interrupted. I also made it so it counted every four second and restarted after 4 seconds. It printed the interrupts per 4 seconds into the serial monitor

In the Distance Sensor assignment I made the led on the metro board change colors using a distn=ance sensor. I made it so the led was red at 5 cm but slowly turned into pink as the distance increased. This pink then slowly turned into blue at 20cm. This blue then turned to light blue and then to green at 35cm. It also printed the distance in the serial monitor.

In the Classes. Objects, and Modules assignment I used a class to make an led change colors by just putting the color in the code. I also made it go through the colors of the rainbiw at two different speeds just using the word rainbow. I did this by adding these codes to the class and then just calling on it to make it run the code.

In the hello_vs_code assignment I learned to use VS and how to add and commit through VS instead of git bash.

In the fancyLed assignment I had to use two sets of 3 leds. The first set alternated and then did a chase. The second set blinked and then sparkled. For the sparkle i used random to make it som random lights would turn on. I then made it so my chase went through all leds instead of just the first 3.
